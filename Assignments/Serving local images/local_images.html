    <p>
      The Peacock's spectacular pattern of eyespots evolved to startle or
      confuse predators, make it one of the most easily recognized and
      best-known species. It is from these wing markings that the butterfly
      gained its common name

    <p>
      The adult butterflies hibernate during the winter months. Typical
      locations of overwintering include tree cavities and on the ground
      underneath loose tree bark (covered by snow).They often emerge from
      hibernation before the snow has completely melted, making it one of the
      first butterflies to take wing in the spring.
